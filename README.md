SQL Queries

The following SQL queries were used to generate the results:

Top 5 Teams by Total Goals Scored


SELECT 
  t.team_name, 
  SUM(g.goal_time) AS total_goals
FROM 
  teams t
  JOIN matches m ON t.team_id = m.match_team1_id
  JOIN goals g ON m.match_id = g.goal_match_id
GROUP BY 
  t.team_name
ORDER BY 
  total_goals DESC
LIMIT 5;


Top 5 Players by Total Goals Scored


SELECT 
  p.player_name, 
  SUM(g.goal_time) AS total_goals
FROM 
  players p
  JOIN goals g ON p.player_id = g.goal_player_id
GROUP BY 
  p.player_name
ORDER BY 
  total_goals DESC
LIMIT 5;


Match Outcomes by Team


SELECT 
  t.team_name, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN m.match_result = 'win' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wins,
  SUM(CASE WHEN m.match_result = 'draw' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS draws,
  SUM(CASE WHEN m.match_result = 'loss' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS losses
FROM 
  teams t
  JOIN matches m ON t.team_id = m.match_team1_id
GROUP BY 
  t.team_name;
